**What is QUnit?**
A flexible and user-friendly JavaScript unit testing framework is called QUnit. It is frequently used for testing JavaScript code and was first created by the jQuery team. JavaScript is used to develop SAP UI5 apps, where QUnit is very helpful.

**Why unit test in SAP?**
SAP unit testing guarantees the dependability and maintainability of your code. It facilitates the early discovery of bugs in the development process, which makes it simpler to address issues before they develop. Building unit tests enables you to:

1. Check to see if your code functions properly.
2. Modify your code with security.
3. Record the way you want your code to behave.
